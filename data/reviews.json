During an intense heat wave, I saw young employees standing outside in black pants, visibly sweating and clearly struggling with the extreme temperatures while taking orders. It was uncomfortable to witness, and honestly, quite upsetting. There has to be a better, safer way to manage this.",

I told the girl taking my order that it didn't make sense to not let us see the menu, and she had no solution...just oh well. And then I get a fraction of what should be the chicken on my minis. Seriously, it was qualified to be a nugget. Check the pictures! The week before that at another location off Sam's drive they totally forgot to give me my minis. This is unacceptable.",

    "caption": "I went into this Chik Fil A location to get a snack on a long road trip. I'd just met with some business associates and was hungry and tired. I went into this location to get some fries and the mens room was disgusting: the floor was literally filled with puddles of urine and the dry areas were sticky.  When I went to order just one order of fries, I noticed the young lady at the counter looking at her phone and completely disinterested in helping me. When I finally caught her attention and placed my order, she took my name, and turned back to her phone. There was a stack of fries already sitting behind her and she could have easily picked one up immediately and for whatever reason chose to do nothing. Beside her I saw a manager laughing and carrying on with an employee who also seemed bored with nothing to do. The interior of the restaurant was almost empty with maybe 2 or 3 people inside eating.  I waited and after a few minutes saw several delivery drives from GrubHub waiting for their orders as well while the staff continued to chat and have fun with their phones and socialize. Meanwhile there were stacks of fries sitting under the lights.  After about ten minutes the young lady reached out to me, without speaking, and handed me the fries. She never acknowledged me in any way or spoke a single word, just stuck it out toward my face.  I would never return to this Chik Fil A location because the mens room was filled with urine puddles and sticky floors, while staff joked around and had fun with their phones - leaving customers like me and delivery drivers waiting around unnecessarily waiting for orders. And on top of it all, the young lady at the desk was rude. When I worked customer service at hotels, restaurants, and in business if I'd treated a client or customer that way at the very least I'd get written up and given a warning. Here, the manager was also chatting it up with a young employee having fun, so either didn't notice it or just didn't care, or both.  So, yes, sticky flooded mens room floors, long waits even when nobody's there, and rude employees.  Who needs it? I don't. I can go to another chicken fast food joint or wait until I get home to eat and know I won't be disrespected again.",

Iâ€™m a frequent Chick-fil-A customer, purchasing meals almost weekly and even a rewards member, but I refuse to waste any more money at this establishment. Itâ€™s been multiple orders I placed where they left out sauces or ingredients. I let it slide the first time but the following week they did the same exact thing. The second time they messed up my order I went inside to address the issue & they refused to accommodate it because they said it was 1 minute past the time breakfast ended. Mind you, the chickfila minis are made out of the regular chickfila nuggets so they are essentially refusing to make fresh nuggets when this is a core lunch and dinner item. Absolutely unacceptable! Wonâ€™t spend another dime and I advise you to do the same.",
